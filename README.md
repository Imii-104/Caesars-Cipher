# Caesars-Cipher
Done on day 8 of #100DaysOfCode

This is a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques.
The program can encode a word by shifting each letter forward by a user-provided number.
It can also decode a word by shifting the letters backward using the same shift value.
Currently, it only works with single words, but an upgrade to handle whole sentences is planned.
This project was built as practice while learning functions, parameters, arguments, and positional/keyword arguments in Python.

# Important Note on File Formatting
This Python file was created using the Pydroid 3 mobile IDE. Due to potential differences in line endings and whitespace handling between mobile and desktop environments, you may encounter minor formatting issues when opening this file on a standard desktop code editor.
If you experience any issues with indentation or line breaks, a simple reformatting using your IDE's built-in tools should resolve them.  This won't affect the code's functionality.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your understanding!
